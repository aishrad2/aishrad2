## 💡 Passions & Interests

I’m driven by curiosity and a love for learning new technologies by applying them in real projects. I enjoy moving quickly when exploring new tools, while also working toward depth and specialization in areas I care about.

I’m especially passionate about building **human-centered technology**—software that considers real people, realistic constraints, and meaningful impact. I’m drawn to projects that address real-world problems and contribute positively beyond just the code.

Collaboration is central to how I work. I enjoy building across disciplines, where different perspectives strengthen ideas and lead to more thoughtful, well-rounded solutions.
